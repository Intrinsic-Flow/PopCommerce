h1. POP Commerce - Plain-Old-Product Commerce
*Commerce that Pops*

h2. Design Goal

The goal for POP Commerce is to be a simple ecommerce application for the sale
of basic products. It is not meant to feature more advanced ecommerce
functionality such as configurable products, products with selectable variants,
and so on.

While meant to be a usable and functional, the primary purpose is to be a easy
to customize starting point for custom ecommerce sites and a demonstration of
the use of Moqui Framework and Mantle entities and services for building
ecommerce applications.

The initial design is meant to be simple in every way, and that involves
various constraints including one credit card, address, and phone number per
customer (all of which can be modified on the fly in the cart).

POP Commerce is based on the Moqui Framework and the Mantle UDM and USL
projects, with requirements inspired by Mantle UBPL.
